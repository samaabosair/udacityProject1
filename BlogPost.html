        <p>Taco Bell has about eight ingredients and yet, they have about 50 items on their menu. And guess what?
          They’re just mixing and matching those same eight ingredients in different ways. With these eight ingredients,
          you can make a taco, a quesadilla, or a [insert your favorite late night Taco Bell treat]! Same idea applies:
          this is a (food) design system. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pattern library</li>
          <li>Modular design</li>
          <li>Component design</li>
          <li>Design language</li>
          <li>User interface library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sure, there are nuances to all of these, but they’re basically doing the same thing: creating a series of
          design components for you and your team to reuse. Sometimes, you’ll even find elements of a design system in a
          style or brand guide.</p>
        <h4>header2</h4>
        <h5>Why should you use a design system?</h5>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="span">Scale – </span>Are you designing a product (or products) that has more than 300
            screens? Will your product(s) grow significantly?</li>
          <li><span class="span"> Consistency –</span> Do you want your products to have consistent branding, look and
            feel, and experience? Does your product currently have 20 different button styles?</li>
          <li><span class="span">Efficiency –</span> Do you want your visual designers, user experience designers, and
            front end developers to work faster and save time?</li>
          <li><span class="span"> Teamwork –</span> Do you have projects where there’s a lot of handoff between
            designers or many designers work on the same project at once?</li>
